        <section>
            <p>In this project, I developed a comprehensive marketing strategy and campaign design for Magnolia Coffee Company, a local coffee chain looking to expand its customer base and increase revenue. The goal was to create a targeted approach that would resonate with the company's ideal customers and set it apart from larger competitors like ClamClams.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Problem and Approach</h2>
            <p>The challenge was to create a marketing plan that would help Magnolia Coffee Company build its customer base and improve its bottom line. My approach involved:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Target Market Analysis:</h3>
                    <p>I identified the ideal customer segments for Magnolia Coffee Company based on demographics and psychographics.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>SMART Objective Setting:</h3>
                    <p>I developed specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound marketing objectives to guide the campaign.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Competitor and SWOT Analysis:</h3>
                    <p>I analyzed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for both Magnolia Coffee Company and its main competitor, ClamClams.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Value Proposition Development:</h3>
                    <p>I created a compelling value proposition to differentiate Magnolia Coffee Company from its competitors.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Customer Persona and Journey Mapping:</h3>
                    <p>I developed detailed customer personas and mapped out their journey to identify key touchpoints and potential friction points.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Findings and Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Through this analysis, I developed several key strategies and recommendations:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Target Market:</h3>
                    <p>University students and young professionals, aged 18-40, with disposable income, seeking third spaces to balance work, social, and family lives.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>SMART Objective:</h3>
                    <p>Over the next two years, solidify Magnolia's position as a viable third space by offering regular events, aiming to boost customer engagement and increase revenue by 15-20%.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Value Proposition:</h3>
                    <p>Magnolia Coffee Company provides a local, neighborhood place to work and meet with friends and clients, balancing hometown flavors with international, fair trade coffees.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Customer Personas:</h3>
                    <p>Two main personas were identified: Sara "Social Butterfly" Barnes and Finn "Family-oriented Professional" Parker, representing key segments of Magnolia's target market.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Marketing Strategies:</h3>
                    <p>Focus on community-building events, leverage social media for promotion, and develop a loyalty program to encourage repeat visits and word-of-mouth marketing.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Customer Interviews</h2>
    
    <div class="interview">
        <h3>Sara "Social Butterfly" Barnes</h3>
        
        <h4>Personal Background</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: Describe your personal demographics.</strong></p>
        <p>A: I'm 22, single, and I rent a flat with two roommates. It's not ideal, but it's cheap and close to my college. I hope to move out soon. I just started my first real job and I think it's going really well. It's practically a minimum wage, but I'm also pretty serious about becoming an influencer. It'll be great to have two sources of income.</p>
        
        <h4>Educational Background</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: Describe your educational background.</strong></p>
        <p>A: I'll get a degree in Digital Media Design when I graduate from the College of Charleston this year. Fingers crossed! I'm optimistic. I have been preparing for this since forever.</p>
        
        <h4>Job Role</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What is your job role? Your title?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I'm a Junior Social Worker. I already feel like this is my calling.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How long have you had this role and title?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Technically, I'm still on my trial period. But my boss already promised me a full-time position.</p>
        
        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What do you like to do in your free time?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I'm always hanging out with my friends. I love good music and good books. I love to travel and taste new dishes. I have so many interests…</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: What are you interested in?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Didn't I just answer this? Friends, music, travel… all those things I listed before.</p>
        
        <h4>Challenges and Barriers</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What are your biggest challenges professionally/personally?</strong></p>
        <p>A: You wouldn't believe how fast I learn at my job. It feels like I've learned more in the last month than during the entire first year. Is this learning curve going to become bumpier? Will I be on my own then? I hope I'll not become one of those stressed 9-to-5 workers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is price or time a concern for the goals you want to achieve?</strong></p>
        <p>A: It'll probably change soon, but, at this moment, money is an issue for me. I would enjoy a slightly more expensive lifestyle than what I can currently afford.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: What setbacks prevent you from achieving your goals?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I like where I am with my education and career. And I can't imagine I won't meet someone special soon. I have so many friends and I always meet new people… But sometimes I wish that my life had more structure. A routine that I can hold on to when all seems a little random.</p>
        
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What are your professional/personal goals?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To be honest, I'm not sure. Yes, I have dreams about my Instagram fan base exploding. I would love it if my job involves more travel. I'm open to seeing what the future holds.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How is your work/life balance?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I don't really believe in "work/life balance". I aim for "integrated living". I want my life and my job to overlap. Give me a life where I'm getting paid for things I love doing, and my hobbies contribute to my job. My career didn't negatively impact how often I hang out with my friends. Not at all. Why would it impact my future family life?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Where do you see yourself in the next five years?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I honestly feel that my life is going to be amazing. Is it naive? I love my job, I'll have the position that my boss holds right now. And that's only if my influencer plans don't pan out. How awesome would it be to get paid just for having followers?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How have your goals changed in the past 3 years?</strong></p>
        <p>A: 3 years ago my only concern was my degree. A good degree, good job, good life, right? I also managed to make so many amazing connections. It may be time to figure out how I can use this network. Hopefully, I'll decimate my student debt in the process.</p>

        <h3>Finn "Family-oriented Professional" Parker</h3>
        
        <h4>Personal Background</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: Describe your personal demographics.</strong></p>
        <p>A: I'm 31 and married to my high school sweetheart. Our first kid was born this year. We are tired but very happy. I really like my job - I'm Q&A Tester in an international company. I don't want to reveal my income, but we are doing ok. Our mortgage was just approved, and we'll move to our first house.</p>
        
        <h4>Educational Background</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: Describe your educational background.</strong></p>
        <p>A: My degree is not related to what I do! I have a bachelor's in Economics. I had trouble finding a job after college, and I took a "temporary" gig as a tester. It was a junior position, they didn't require any skills besides thoroughness. Since then, I've finished multiple online courses about Software Development Processes and Quality Assurance. Now I focus mostly on learning Python and PyTest framework specifically.</p>
        
        <h4>Job Role</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What is your job role? Your title?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Q&A Tester. I hope to move to a Junior Q&A Engineer role soon.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How long have you had this role and title?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I have had this role for a couple of years now. I switched workplaces multiple times (in my record year, I worked for 4 companies). My salary went up, but my responsibilities were more or less the same. I'm lucky this job is in demand.</p>
        
        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What do you like to do in your free time?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I used to love Role-playing video Games like Dungeons and Dragons… I can't remember the last time I played it. Nowadays, I'm lucky to have the time to watch other people play on YouTube or Twitch.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: What are you interested in?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I used to have so many interests. But currently, my search history is mostly about parenting. I never would have guessed that I'll be reading about "5 best baby nasal aspirators" in my free time.</p>
        
        <h4>Challenges and Barriers</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What are your biggest challenges professionally/personally?</strong></p>
        <p>A: There are so many people working in my company. We recruit someone every month. I can't be sure that "non-programming" testers will always be in such demand. Not if it can be automated. I need to get better, but I don't have much time to learn. And sometimes it's not easy to do at home. It feels bad to have to split my attention between my job and my family.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is price or time a concern for the goals you want to achieve?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Time - without question. There are free resources, and my company is happy to pay for those that aren't. I have so few moments when I can truly focus. I wish I could shut my phone and lock myself somewhere for an hour every day. I would be a senior engineer already.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: What setbacks prevent you from achieving your goals?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Well, I wouldn't call my child a setback… but life has a way of getting in your way. I don't think I finished any side projects since my wife got pregnant. Sometimes I feel overstimulated with all that is going on in my life.</p>
        
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What are your professional/personal goals?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I have two priorities now. My job and my family. Are those contradictory? It often feels like it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How is your work/life balance?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I don't have one. I feel that good times at my job won't last forever. I'll be sorry if I don't strike this iron while it's hot. On the other hand, I know how important my son's early experiences are. There is no way to get those back if I waste this time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Where do you see yourself in the next five years?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I'm fairly sure that I'll have a new, more programming-oriented role in the same industry. Would I bet on this? 5 years ago I was wrong about what the future holds. I may be wrong now as well.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How have your goals changed in the past 3 years?</strong></p>
        <p>A: I don't think I really had goals 3 years ago. I was drifting. From one opportunity to another. And I was lucky. I don't want to rely on luck anymore. I need to focus and make sure that I don't waste time anymore.</p>
